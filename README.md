## What is TrenDuk?

This website my personal project driven by motivation to reveal the change AlphaGo brought to the Go industry. It specifically visualizes frequency of each joseki
each year. I am aiming to show more visualization with a detailed categorization.

## Stack Usage

This application is separated in 3 parts: service, web, and api. Service portion is solely built with Golang, with usage of web scraping. I have not deployed it since it is very costly on operations. The web is built with NextJS (Typescript integration) and api is built with Typescript NodeJS.
